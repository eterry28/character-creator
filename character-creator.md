# RPG Character Stat Creator 

Make a program which will randomly create a characterâ€™s stats based on several rules set forth by the user. Have it generate a class, gender, strength/magic/dexterity points, and extra abilities or trades. Have it save it to a file which can then be printed out by a dungeon master.
